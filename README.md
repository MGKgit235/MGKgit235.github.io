This project contains SQL scripts to analyze COVID-19 case data and vaccination progress across Indian states and union territories. The goal is to explore trends, identify high-risk regions, and understand demographic and geographic patterns in vaccination and infection data.


States with most number of deaths
States with most number of cured
States with most number of confirmed cases
States with the most vaccinations
states with the most doses administered
gender disparity
most vaccinated age groups

Import the SQL scripts into your preferred SQL environment (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL).

Ensure the data matches the table schema.

Run the queries in covid19.sql to explore the dataset.

The data sets were downloaded from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india)
